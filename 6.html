<p class="text-bg-info fs-3 w-75 pt-3 ps-5">The class .active makes a button appear pressed, and the disabled attribute makes 
    a button unclickable. Note that <a> elements do not support the disabled attribute
         and must therefore use the .disabled class to make it visually appear disabled.
